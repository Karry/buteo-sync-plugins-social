This repository contains plugins which can provide data synchronization
with various social services (such as Facebook and Twitter).

It provides a basic structure which is intended to be simple to extend
to allow more plugins to be written for further social services or data
synchronization services.  The framework supports synchronizing data of
various types (contacts, calendar events, notifications, etc).

The plugins are Buteo synchronization framework plugins.
Each plugin can be built either in out-of-process mode or in-process
mode (that is, as a shared library or standalone executable).

The code in this repository is LGPLv2.1 licensed.  Any contributions to
this repository must be of either this license or a less restrictive
license (such as BSD license).
